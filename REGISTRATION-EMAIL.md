Subject: Math Facts Acquisition - App Registration & Integration

Hi TimeBack Team,

Per the request of Zach Groshell and Andy Montgomery, I am registering the Math Facts Acquisition app on the TimeBack platform. Below are the required registration details:

REQUIRED FIELDS:

App Name: Math Facts Acquisition
Description: 26-lesson addition fact acquisition course for K-3 students using Direct Instruction methodology with Series Saying and Fact Families formats.
Full Description: Math Facts Acquisition is a comprehensive addition fact mastery program for students in grades K-3 (ages 5-8). The course uses Direct Instruction methodology with two teaching formats: Series Saying (for initial fact introduction) and Fact Families (for teaching the commutative property and turnarounds). Students progress through 26 structured lessons, each requiring 85% mastery on quizzes before advancing. The program includes pre-generated audio instruction, visual feedback, error correction protocols, and a final comprehensive 26-question assessment. It bridges the gap between conceptual understanding and fluency training, preparing students for rapid fact retrieval practice.
